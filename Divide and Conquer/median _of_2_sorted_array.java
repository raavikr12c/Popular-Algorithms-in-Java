// A Simple Merge based O(n) solution to find median of two sorted arrays  in java

/*
Median of two sorted arrays of same size:
There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Here we find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n).
We use merge procedure of merge sort. Keep track of count while comparing elements of two arrays. If count becomes n(For 2n elements), we have reached the median. Take the average of the elements at indexes n-1 and n in the merged array.
